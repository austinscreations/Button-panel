# Button-panel
Low cost RGB button panel for home automation - based off superhouse.tv switch setup

After seeing the new RGB switch panels that jon from superhouse.tv is making teh thing that has been noted is the switches cost a fair bit of money. 

I thought it might be possible to 3d print parts and use clear acrylic tubing / rod to create low cost versions of teh panels.
To start I've designed two PCB's one has 4 leds per button to emulate teh current ring light buttons
the second version uses one center led for a cenetr lighting in the button - acyrlic rod would be inserted into a 3d print.

Once I have a chance I plan to produce the pcb and order parts on ebay and create the 3d print assemblies to see what teh cost would be and if it works well.

added code that will be used during livestream. haven't got tasmota to control the lights correctly yet; thus will be using custom code

PCB's arrived which means I'll be doing a livestream of their assembly and testing https://youtu.be/Dpo3wsEXy4c

Updated 3d files to fit around capacitors and ethernet connector. The 3d files and pcb's will be re-layed out to fix these in the next version. allowing for faster 3d printing, vs having holes / cutouts made.

I've ordered PCB's to test. 
Created 3d photo of pcb assemblies. Next versions will use esp8266 direct vs D1 mini.
Cost Sheet updated.

reformated files
added new version 2 which makes the pcb compact - allows for 24mm spacing between each button matching the assembly of teh superhouse button panels - it allso allowed for teh buttons to be centered on a wall plate. wall plate is normal cover / size for single gang north america box
3D step files for each button design assembly has been added - these are untested - no parts on order yet.
future possible version my have the 0.1mm pitch conenctor to match up to the new superhouse tv RGB button assembly.

updating pcb files as the 1000uf capacitor was the wrong size (footprint is now 10x10mm)
adding photos of the pcb for both versions
added parts list for both versions
added rough cost breakdown of buying parts on ebay

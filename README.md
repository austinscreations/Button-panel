# Button-panel
Low cost RGB button panel for home automation - based off superhouse.tv switch setup

After seeing the new RGB switch panels that jon from superhouse.tv is making teh thing that has been noted is the switches cost a fair bit of money. 

I thought it might be possible to 3d print parts and use clear acrylic tubing / rod to create low cost versions of teh panels.
To start I've designed two PCB's one has 4 leds per button to emulate teh current ring light buttons
the second version uses one center led for a cenetr lighting in the button - acyrlic rod would be inserted into a 3d print.

Once I have a chance I plan to produce the pcb and order parts on ebay and create the 3d print assemblies to see what teh cost would be and if it works well.

updating pcb files as the 1000uf capacitor was the wrong size (footprint is now 10x10mm)
adding photos of the pcb for both versions
added parts list for both versions
added rough cost breakdown of buying parts on ebay
